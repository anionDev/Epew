# General

epew (ExternalProgramExecutionWrapper) is a tool to wrap program-calls with some useful functions.

## Features

epew is a commandline-tool. There is no gui. The main-advantage of epew is to be used when

- it is difficult to pass special characters (backslashs, quotes, etc.) from commandline to another program (use epew with the `--ArgumentIsBase64Encoded`-switch).
- it is difficult to get stdout, stderr or the exitcode of the program (use epew with the `--StdOutFile`- or `--StdErrFile`- or `--ExitCodeFile`-switch).
- you want to have a simple timeout when running a program (use epew with the `--TimeoutInMilliseconds`-switch).
- you want to print the output to the console but also log the output into a file when running a program. Both (console and logfile) can of course have timestamps and a distinction between stderr and stdout.

Other features:

- epew is available for Linux and Windows.
- epew resolves environment-variables (e. g. you can set `git` as program instead of `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe` (which would also be possible)).

                                    the execution process before it will by

Exitcodes:

2147393801: If no program was executed

2147393802: If a fatal error occurred

2147393803: If the executed program was aborted due to the given timeout

2147393881: If executed on MacOS (applies only to the pip-package)

2147393882: If executed on an unknown OS (applies only to the pip-package)

2147393883: If an (unexpected) exception occurred (applies only to the pip-package)

If running synchronously then the exitcode of the executed program will be set as exitcode of epew.

If running asynchronously then the process-id of the executed program will be set as exitcode of epew.

## Technical details

### The pip-package

Installing epew via pip does really install epew. It does not install another implementation of epew with same behavior. The pip-package of epew takes the binary-files of epew (which are written in C# and compiled for the [runtimes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) `win-x64` and `linux-x64`), wraps them to a bundle and simple calls the correct one dependent on your OS.

### Strong name

The officially released `epew.dll`-file is always signed with the key with the short-id `79cae7246084aa22`. Do not trust any `epew.dll`-file which are not signed with this key.
Only `epew.dll` will be signed with this key. All other files contained in a binary-release of epew are not signed by this key.
You can verify the key using [sn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool) with `sn -T epew.dll`.
