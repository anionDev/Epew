# General

Epew (ExternalProgramExecutionWrapper) is a tool to wrap program-calls with some useful functions.
It is something like a wrapper or a shim to be able to add timestamps to the output, write output to files, and to add some more functionalities.
Due to the possibility to encode arguments for program-calls in base64 Epew is especially helpful when you want to run a program with some arguments which contain every kind of escape-character which should not be escaped but simply be passed to the executed program.
Adding a timeout is also of course possible.
Epew is available for Windows and Linux.
If you do not know the full path of the program, Epew of course uses the `PATH`-environment-variable to find the desired program, and this also works with some tricky cmd-tools like npm on Windows.

Epew is a commandline-tool.
There is no gui.
The main-advantage of epew is to be used when

- it is difficult to pass special characters (backslashs, quotes, etc.) from commandline to another program (use epew with the `--ArgumentIsBase64Encoded`-switch).
- it is difficult to get stdout, stderr or the exitcode of the program (use epew with the `--StdOutFile`- or `--StdErrFile`- or `--ExitCodeFile`-switch).
- you want to have a simple timeout when running a program (use epew with the `--TimeoutInMilliseconds`-switch).
- you want to print the output to the console but also log the output into a file when running a program. Both (console and logfile) can of course have timestamps and a distinction between stderr and stdout.

Other features:

- epew is available for Linux and Windows.
- epew resolves environment-variables. (For example you can set `git` as program instead of `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe`. Both variants are working.)

Exitcodes:

2147393801: If no program was executed

2147393802: If a fatal error occurred

2147393803: If the executed program was aborted due to the given timeout

If running synchronously then the exitcode of the executed program will be set as exitcode of epew.

If running asynchronously then the process-id of the executed program will be set as exitcode of epew.
